Basic api fetcher for the ReVoYo server on the platform Revolt.
1. Sends a daily message on login via the daily.js.
2. You will need to specify the channel id and also give the bot appropriate permissions to post a message to that channel.
3. For bot to fetch api, a wolframalpha api token and exchangerate api token are required. They can be added to the config.json. You will also need to add your Revolt bot token there.
4. Contact me via Revolt (@mitachibana) or email: mishatachibana@gmail.com
