Basic api fetcher for the ReVoYo server on the platform Revolt.
1. Sends a daily message on login via the daily.js.
2. To diagnose relog issues, the function in quote.js was made to test if the relog was due to inactivity.
3. For bot to fetch api, a wolframalpha api token and exchangerate api token are required. They can be added to the config.json
4. I have only 2 months worth of JavaScript studies, my apologies if parts of the code are problematic!
5. Contact me via Revolt (@mitachibana) or email: mishatachibana@gmail.com
