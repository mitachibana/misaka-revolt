Basic api fetcher for the ReVoYo server on the platform Revolt.
1. Sends a daily message on login via the daily.js.
2. pinger() function sends a random inspirational quote to a channel every 30 minutes in order to avoid kick due to inactivity.
3. For bot to fetch api, a wolframalpha api token and exchangerate api token are required. They can be added to the config.json. You will also need to add your Revolt bot token there.
4. I have only 2 months worth of JavaScript studies, my apologies if parts of the code are problematic!
5. Contact me via Revolt (@mitachibana) or email: mishatachibana@gmail.com
